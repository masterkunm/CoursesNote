### selective repeat

## reliable data transfer conclusion

SR sender window size = receiver window size <= $2^{m-1}$

checksums (for error detection) 

timers (for loss detection)

acknowledgments

* cumulative
* selective

sequence numbers (duplicates, windows)

sliding windows (for efficiency)

reliability protocols use the above to decide when and what to retransmit or acknowledge
